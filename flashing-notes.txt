Notes on initial flashing of devices

---------
Shelly EM

Need to use 24/26 ga wire/pins to connect to header.

with octogon facing away, left to right:

1 gnd        -> gnd
2 GPIO0      -> gnd
3 rst
4 vcc (3.3)  -> vcc
5 RxD        -> USB to TTL TxD
6 TxD        -> USB to TTL RxD

power off device
short GPIO0 to ground
power on device
let GPIO0 float

cd ~/duckling/containers/esphome
pipenv shell
esptool.py --port=$(usb_serial) --baud 115200 erase_flash
name=house-panel
esptool.py --port=$(usb_serial) --baud 115200  write_flash -fm qio 0x0000 $name/.pioenvs/$name/firmware.bin

This never worked for the EM so I tried going through Tasmota as per https://savjee.be/2020/09/shelly-2.5-flash-esphome-over-the-air/
Had to go through tasmota-minimal but it finally worked:

conda activate pio
cd ~/git/Tasmota
pio run --target upload --enviroment tasmota-minimal

Supposedly I need to set Option78 to allow non-tasmota uploads

Note that I still had to cycle power on the device after flashing to get the ADE to talk
correctly via I2C


--------------------------
Circuit Setup Energy meter

When flashing unplug usb, press and hold boot, plug device in, release
boot, start flash

Flashed fine with esphomeflasher and an esphome image


------------
Sonoff S31

IIRC, this flashed via serial directly from ESPHome


--------
tinyPico

This flashed via the USB/Serial built into the device

esptool.py --port=$(usb_serial) --baud 115200  write_flash -z 0x1000 $name/.pioenvs/$name/firmware.bin

Had to install via Tasmota as I did the Shelly EM for it to work.


--------
wemos d1

commented out conda
started shell
cd ~/git/esphome
pipenv run bash
pipenv install esptool
esptool.py --before default_reset --after hard_reset --baud 115200 --chip esp8266 write_flash 0x0 ~/Downloads/bench-logger.bin
pyserial-miniterm
... 
Worked like a champ from the mac looks like it was really the esptool invocation


conda create -n esp pip
conda activate esp
pip install esptool
esptool.py --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash 0x0 ~/Downloads/bench-logger.bin
...
Note that it auto-detected the serial port.

-------
esp32 (hilietgo TTGO module)

can't get it to load. I think it may be missing a bootloader

Maybe try: https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher

finally got that to work with conda
conda activate esphome
esphomeflasher ~/Downloads/bench-logger.bin
And it flashed it just fine.

pythonw `which esphomeflasher`

------------
Sonoff TX T0

Disconnect mainboard from relay module, wire in vcc rx tx gnd
connect esp8266 side of R19 to gpio0

esphomeflasher ~/Downloads/foo.bin


------------
Gosund Smart Light Switch SW1, model KS-602S

Use T6 to open
Has labeled pads on top of board for rx/tx/vcc/gnd/io0


------------
Gosund SW2 Dimmer
Use T6 to open
Has labeled pads on top of board for rx/tx/vcc/gnd/io0

Never got the tyua MCU to talk

------------
Treatlife 2 way dimmer, DS02

Had to make connections directly to ESP8266 to flash it
Make sure to short the "reset" switch to keep the tuya in reset
during flashing. 

Flashed fine, couldn't get tyua mcu to work with tasmota. well, kinda did.
It would toggle it on/off but the dimmer didn't work
https://templates.blakadder.com/treatlife_DS02S.html
Template: {"NAME":"DS02S Dimmer","GPIO":[0,107,0,108,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":54}
Backlog setoption97 1; TuyaSend2 3,10; DimmerRange 10,1000

Worked well in tasmota and presented a dimmer to HA but not to the in-device
web UI


----------
Martin Jerry Dimmer SD01

Pin Signal
CN1-1   TXD
CN1-2   RXD
CN1-3   GPIO2
CN1-4   GPIO0
CN1-5   GROUND
CN1-6   VCC (square pad)

Works pretty well with esphome and with homa assistant
still no interface for dimmer in the esphome web ui

Tasmota works well with template:
{"NAME":"MJ-SD01 Dimmer","GPIO":[34,33,0,323,576,322,0,0,321,416,320,96,256],"FLAG":0,"BASE":73}
and presents a dimmer slider.

I think this one is a keeper


-------------
Martin Jerry Switch MJ-S01

Pin     Signal
CN1-1   TXD
CN1-2   RXD
CN1-3   GPIO2
CN1-4   GPIO0
CN1-5   GROUND
CN1-6   VCC (square pad)

Flashes fine.

Under current esphome, it keeps reseting itself on the wifi timeout.

-----------
Treatlife DS03 fan/light dimmer switch (front only snaps on)
Also Esmlfe DDS03 (Opens with 4 phillips on front of switch)

See https://www.digiblur.com/2020/07/the-tasmota-fan-controller-ive-been.html for flashing notes


--------------
tinypio:

Flashing esphome directly onto the tinypico never worked.
Had to load tasmota onto it first:

conda activate pio
cd ~/git/Tasmota
pio run --target upload --environment tasmota32
... load the web GUI on the device and upload esphome binary


-----------------
magichome: running tasmota 
Failed to upload when running regular tasmota image
http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota-minimal.bin
and then flashed the esphome image from the web UT and it worked.

---------------
ElectroDragon RGB module

Had to swap Rx/Tx between serial adaptor and board but it programs just fine
